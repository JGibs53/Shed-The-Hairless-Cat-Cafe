# Shed-The-Hairless-Cat-Cafe
Shed the Hairless cat cafe is the homepage for The Only Cat Cafe that caters specifically to hairless breed cats and occasionally some lizards. 
It features a lizard counting game and a quiz that seemingly matches you with a cat. 

The Capstone requirements include:
Javascript Array for the questions in the Cat Cafe Quiz that fetch an image to display from the third-party API: https://api.thecatapi.com

The Lizard Guessing Game uses a regular expression to validate that the user input is between the numbers 1-50 and informs the user that is invalid if they input anything outside of that.

No special requirements are neccesary to run the project. Visual Studio Code or equivalent program is adequate.
