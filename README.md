# Shed-The-Hairless-Cat-Cafe
Shed the Hairless cat cafe is the homepage for The Only Cat Cafe that caters specifically to hairless breed cats and occasionally some lizards. 
It features a lizard counting game and a quiz that seemingly matches you with a cat. 
A sticky navbar that responds to the screen size in media query and disappears. 

The Capstone requirements include:
* Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is diplayed in your app. 
Javascript Array for the questions in the Cat Cafe Quiz 

* Retrieve dada from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app
The quiz fetches an image to display from the third-party API: https://api.thecatapi.com

* Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it. 
The Lizard Guessing Game uses a regular expression to validate that the user input is between the numbers 1-50 and informs the user that is invalid if they input anything outside of that.

No special requirements are neccesary to run the project.
Standard browser, Visual Studio Code or equivalent program is adequate.
